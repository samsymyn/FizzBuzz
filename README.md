I used Node.js + express.js to build the backend for the FizzBuzz app.


To run make sure to have Node.js installed, once installed, install the following packages.

express
    : 'npm install express'

    : 'npm install body-parser'

To Run:

    * To run you will need to have the following added to scripts "start": "nodemon server.js" within package.json
    * run 'npm start' to get the server kicked off, manual testing with POSTMAN
